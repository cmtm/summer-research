= Autoassociative memory

Abstract Autoassociative memory

== parameters

n: number of neurons
c: cluster size
l: number of clusters  (l = n/c)

Only two of these are needed, which two are the most descriptive?

Do all out Autoassociative memories (AAMs) store edges as a well 
defined list of node-node pairs or do some of them use different 
methods such as an adjacency matrix or a lossy method?

== functions

=== storeMessage( c characters in range log2(l) )

returns nothing.

Can something be returned such as a pass/fail or do all AAMs not 
know if the message was successfully stored?

can storage take variable time between stores on a single architecture? 
How about between stores on different architectures?

=== readMessage( c characters in range log2(l); some characters can be erased)

What exactly does a read return? Can it determine if a no message 
that matches the input exists? Can it ever return a message with 
characters that are different from the known input characters?
ex: 110x   returns   1111

should return c characters in range log2(l)  and possibly a 
found/not found flag Should also return the number of iterations 
taken to read message. There is also the possibility of several 
characters being valid given a certain erasure. Should a list of 
these characters be returned or can the hardware not handle this?
